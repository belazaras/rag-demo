# Description  
**IP-Based Pricing & Experimentation Tracker (Shopify, Pre-Hydrogen)**  
Built a custom JavaScript tracking and pricing engine for Shopify stores that assigned users to pricing tiers and preserved tier consistency across sessions/devices using IP geolocation + cookie logic. The system enabled A/B testing of price strategies and dynamically served the correct tiered product pricing without exposing variant logic to the customer.  
**Key contributions**  
* Implemented geo + cookie-based tier assignment and persistence logic.  
* Added dynamic pricing-rule engine for A/B tests across multiple pricing tiers.  
* Instrumented core funnel analytics: product view, add-to-cart, and checkout start.  
* Created a front-end template compilation workflow for runtime customization (before Shopify Hydrogen).  
* Modeled products/prices per tier and built seamless client-side switching while hiding internal tier structure from end users.  
**Tech** JavaScript, Shopify theme/custom templates, client-side tracking and experimentation logic.
